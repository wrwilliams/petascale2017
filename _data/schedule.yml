    - title: Dyninst and MRNet Update
      author: Bill Williams and Sasha Nicolas
      affiliation: University of Wisconsin
      length: 1800
      abstract: "The Dyninst suite of tools continues to evolve as we face the challenges of
                    analyzing and instrumenting increasingly complex binaries in exascale environments.
                    In the past year, we have continued work to improve our support for new architectures (ARM64),
                    cross-architecture binary analysis, and performance improvements. As we work towards Dyninst 10.0,
                    we want to share our vision for a better way to expose Dyninst's components to users and make our
                    APIs easier to use."

    - title: Continuous Clock Synchronization for Accurate Performance Analysis
      author: Johannes Ziegenbalg
      affiliation: TU Dresden
      length: 1800
      abstract: "Clock synchronization is a key prerequisite for accurate performance analysis.
                     This is particularly true for most HPC systems, due to the lack of a
                     system-wide timer. The effects of different clock properties lead to false
                     measurements and wrong conclusions. Often these errors remain undetected by the
                     user.

                     Different environmental effects cause continuous changes to clock properties
                     over time. This behavior is ignored by the usual post-mortem approach for
                     clock synchronization. In order to improve time measurement accuracy we
                     implemented a method for continuous clock synchronization. In this talk we
                     share our experiences and draw conclusions for tool development. "

      author: Michael Brim
      affiliation: ORNL
      length: 1800
      abstract: "SNOflake is a general purpose Scalable Network Overlay technology targeted at
                     HPC environments. SNOflake supports deployments of overlay networks spanning
                     many network domains (e.g., compute clusters, service nodes, and storage
                     system). SNOflake extends the tree-based overlay network (TBON) technology
                     pioneered by MRNet into a ring-of-TBONs architecture where one or more TBONs
                     are placed on each network domain. This presentation will first cover the
                     SNOflake design goals and architecture, and then discuss two ORNL software
                     technologies, MELT and ExCDS, that leverage SNOflake for scalable end-to-end
                     monitoring and management of HPC storage I/O."

        author: Tatyana Mineeva and Rashawn Knapp
        affiliation: Intel
        length: 1800
        abstract: "    In collaboration with performance tool developers, our team enables 
                       open-source HPC analyzers and measurement tools for CORAL 
                       (Collaboration of Oak Ridge, Argonne, and Livermore) supercomputer 
                       installations at Argonne National Laboratory.
 
                       We present our progress on adding support for AVX-512 vector instructions 
                       to Valgrind, a dynamic instrumentation framework, widely known for its 
                       memcheck tool. This support will allow Valgrind to instrument
                       binaries containing AVX-512 instructions on the most current Intel(tm) Xeon 
                       Phi processor, codenamed Knights Landing (KNL), the recent Xeon Skylake 
                       server platforms, and Aurora, the successor to Argonne’s KNL based Theta.  
                       We will highlight the notable features of the AVX-512 extensions, and our 
                       contributions to date.  
                       
                       Additionally, we provide an HPC focused overview of capabilities available 
                       with Intel performance analysis tools. Recently, a number of HPC-oriented 
                       features, including a roofline model and vectorization advice, have been 
                       added to Intel tools. We will show case several examples of using some of 
                       features on a single KNL node and on a modest-sized KNL cluster.  
                       
                       Most of Intel’s performance tools are available at no cost to qualified open 
                       source contributors, students, and educators for non-commercial use."

        author: "Doug Pase"
        affiliation: "Sandia National Labs"
        length: 1800
        abstract: "At Sandia, it isn't the unique challenges of exascale computing that are getting in the way of tool
        use. It is the mundane issues of reliability, robustness, being able to work with large scale applications, run
        on large scale systems under real life environments, etc. Tools are, for the most part, light enough, fast
        enough, and manage data well enough for very large core count applications. In the author's experience, where
        they fail is being able to run at all on production applications in production environments. Failures often
        occur when the application is large (in terms of LOC), or when production operating systems, compilers,
        languages, and libraries (e.g., Kokkos, Trilinos, or MKL) are used. It's not sufficient that a tool work for
        small applications on 100,000 cores if it doesn't also work on real codes running with systems, libraries,
        compilers and languages found in production environments."

      - title: "Exposing Hidden Performance Optimizations in High Performance GPU Applications"
        author: Benjamin Welton
        affiliation: UW-Madison
        length: 1800
        abstract: "The emergence of leadership class systems with nodes containing many-core accelerators, such as GPUs,
        has the potential to vastly increase the performance of distributed applications. Exploiting the additional
        parallelism that many-core accelerators offer is fraught with challenges. Developers and existing performance
        tools focus on a subset of these challenges, primarily the identification of CPU code that may be suited for
        many-core parallelization and improving the efficiency of existing many-core code. While this focus has
        resulted in application performance improvements, a significant amount of untapped performance still remains.
        Untapped performance opportunities take the form of missed unobvious many-core parallelization opportunities as
        well as inefficiencies in handling interactions with the accelerator, such as memory copies and
        synchronization. In this work we address three issues: (1) characterize the missed performance opportunities
        in many-core applications that are not detected by current performance tools and techniques, (2) design
        detection methods that can be used by performance tools to identify these missed opportunities, and (3) apply
        these techniques to five large scale scientific applications (Qball, QBox, Hoomd-blue, LAMMPs, and cuIBM),
        resulting in a reduction of their execution time by 18% and 87%."

        author: David Montoya
        affiliation: LANL
        length: 1800
        abstract: "We have traditionally assessed performance at the application internals and its immediate resources.
        With the complexities of increasing scale and unique architectures, performance has taken a more holistic
        perspective. How the computational environment is designed, its constraints, and ability to balance resource
        use is a key aspect in performance. There are varying perspectives of performance depending on differing
        stakeholders. This talk will review many of the drivers, approaches, and challenges of an integrated performance
        environment."

        author: Michael Chynoweth
        affiliation: Intel
        length: 1800
        abstract: "Currently the last branch records are being used to determine the paths of
                       execution and optimize code layout with profile guided optimizations. This
                       presentation will cover the research we are accomplishing to take PGO beyond
                       fixing text/code section issues and how it will be used to assist targeted
                       optimizations through determining which portion of the pipeline is stalled
                       and apply optimizations specifically for that bottleneck. Specifically we
                       will cover aggressive loop optimizations, data layout, lock/cache contention
                       determined through use of ~100 performance monitoring events and automatically
                       apply the right compiler optimizations for the execution characteristics of
                       each application."

      - title: "TMAM: Top-down Microarchitecture Analysis Method simplifies Cycle Accounting"
        author: Ahmad Yasin
        affiliation: Intel
        length: 1800
        abstract: "    Top-down Microarchitecture Analysis Method (TMAM) is an industry-proven
                       systematic approach that identifies performance bottlenecks in out-of-order
                       cores. Identifying true bottlenecks lets developers focus software tuning to
                       remediate them and improve efficiently on same hardware. It further enables
                       computer architects to better understand resource demands of emerging
                       workloads when designing future hardware. TMAM simplifies cycle-accounting
                       using microarchitecture-independent metrics organized in one single hierarchy
                       which makes analysis simple. Using TMAM, the high-learning curve associated
                       with each microarchitecture generation is replaced by a structured drill-down
                       that guides the user to true performance limiters. This talk will present the
                       key challenges that cycle-accounting faces and how the basic metrics of TMAM
                       address them on Intel Core/Xeon products."
      - title: "Isoefficiency in Practice: Configuring and Understanding the Performance of Task-based Applications"
        author: Sergei Shudler
        affiliation: TU Darmstadt
        length: 1800
        abstract: "Task-based programming offers an elegant way to express units of
                       computation and the dependencies among them, making it easier to
                       distribute the computational load evenly across multiple cores. However, this
                       separation of problem decomposition and parallelism requires a sufficiently
                       large input problem to achieve satisfactory efficiency on a given number of
                       cores. Unfortunately, finding a good match between input size and core count
                       usually requires significant experimentation, which is expensive and sometimes
                       even impractical. In this paper, we propose an automated empirical method for
                       finding the isoefficiency function of a task-based program, binding
                       efficiency, core count, and the input size in one analytical expression. This
                       allows the latter two to be adjusted according to given (realistic) efficiency
                       objectives. Moreover, we not only find (i) the actual isoefficiency function
                       but also (ii) the function one would yield if the program execution was free
                       of resource contention and (iii) an upper bound that could only be reached if
                       the program was able to maintain its average parallelism throughout its
                       execution. The difference between the three helps to explain low efficiency,
                       and in particular, it helps to differentiate between resource contention and
                       structural conflicts related to task dependencies or scheduling. The insights
                       gained can be used to co-design programs and shared system resources."

        length: 1800
        abstract: "Sometimes programmers do a good job but the execution does not report the
                       expected performance. The first step to improve the performance is to
                       understand what is going on, and flexible tools like Paraver are key to face
                       unknown problems that can be anywhere.

                       During the tools training, I used to ask for a code from the attendees to be
                       used for the demo, but sometimes no example is provided. In these cases I run
                       the Lulesh benchmark. As a result, I have collected Paraver traces of Lulesh
                       running on many different systems. The talk will present the high variability
                       I have observed on the achieved performance with the same source code, as well
                       as the ability of our performance tools to pinpoint what is causing the loss
                       of performance."

      - title: Autotools for Supercomputers
        author: Christian Feld
        affiliation: Juelich Supercomputing Center
        length: 1800
        abstract: "Developing portable software is hard. To mitigate this process, leveraging
                       the widely adopted GNU autotools can be beneficial as they significantly
                       reduce the effort of writing portable build systems. However, assumptions
                       made by GNU autotools do not match the obstacles developers face on today's
                       supercomputers with their various combinations of login- and compute-node
                       architectures, compilers, and libraries. With Autotools for Supercomputers
                       (AfS), we propose a modular framework on top of GNU autotools that addresses
                       this mismatch by hiding the complexities of system diversity from developers
                       and users, offering reasonable defaults as well as fuss-free options for
                       customization.

                       For developers, AfS reduces the effort of creating portable make targets to
                       the choice for which architecture to build them (login- and/or compute-node,
                       MPI, accelerator), while users benefit from a unified and simplified
                       configuration process. Last but not least, build system maintainers are
                       provided with working solutions to produce robust and maintainable systems,
                       at the same time preventing from common pitfalls, particularly with regard
                       to cross-compilation. AfS is actively maintained and successfully used by
                       several projects running on a wide variety of supercomputers."

        affiliation: LLNL
        abstract: "In this talk we will discuss tightly integrating performance tools into
                       applications.  Building tightly-coupled performance tools enables
                       capabilities like \"always on\" performance analysis, performance history
                       tracking, and performance introspection.  It also simplifies tool
                       development by letting tools leverage application infrastructure.  This
                       talk will focus on new tool components that enable tighter application and
                       performance tool coupling.  We will discuss Gotcha, which
                       provides a mechanism for tools to intercept application operations, and
                       SPOT, web infrastructure for visualizing performance history.  By making
                       our tools an essential component in applications we can raise both the
                       visibility and importance of performance tools in the HPC community."

        author: "David Boehme"
        affiliation: "LLNL"
        length: 1800
        abstract: "Many performance analysis tools in the HPC space perform some form of
                   aggregation to compute summary information of a series of performance
                   measurements, from summations to more complex operations like
                   histograms. In current profilers, however, most aspects that control
                   the aggregation are hard-coded, limiting results to certain
                   pre-defined profile types (e.g., call-path time profiles).
                   In this talk, we present Caliper's new aggregation approach, where
                   users can define custom aggregation schemes in a simple SQL-like
                   description language. This allows us to create performance profiles
                   with application-specific data dimensions that would be difficult to
                   obtain with traditional profiling tools."

                   to I/O as an opportunity for performance optimization. Unfortunately, the tool framework for analysis
                   of I/O performance is not as robust as that for computational performance. Tools that exist, such as
                   IOR and Darshan, target a very small slice of I/O performance. No tool exists which measures the
                   real-world I/O performance of an application running under real workloads, and tools that create
                   artificial I/O to model performance do not account for network contention.

                   Additionally complicating this space is the introduction of hierarchical storage into the I/O space.
                   With the increased prevalence of burst buffers and other forms of hierarchical storage, we can
                   expect to find new answers to historically well-studied problems such as optimal checkpointing
                   frequency.

                   As user need for I/O performance increases, there will need to be a paradigm shift in the performance
                   tools community to including I/O in our understanding of application performance. Bringing the
                   insights of the scalable tools community to I/O performance tools will increase our total
                   understanding of performance in the HPC sphere."

        length: 900
        abstract: "Another year later and libabigail’s ABI verification has improved considerably. Intra-compiler
        verification seems fairly solid and Inter-compiler ABI compatibility has become an area of more interest within
        Red Hat due to our bootstrapping of the GPGPU toolchain based on LLVM for future products and to facilitate
        our participation with OpenHPC. This short talk updates last year’s discussion on inter-compiler ABI
        compatibility. It outlines some of the continuing challenges and a few breakthroughs."

        author: "William Jalby"
        affiliation: "University of Versailles"
        abstract: "Data access latency can be a major performance issue and is very often overlooked.
        Data access bandwidth is considered as a major performance limiter while in some cases, the dominating factor is latency.
        In this talk we will present a tool for analyzing data latency impact on performance and providing some hints
        on data access optimization."

        author: Marty Itzkowitz
        affiliation: Software Consultant
        length: 1800
        abstract: "Long before there was Unix, C, C++, Java, email, internet, ..., there was
                   still High Performance Computing.  In this talk, I will describe the dominant
                   machines of that era, the IBM 709x, and the CDC 6600 and 7600.

                   I'll talk about the interesting characteristics of those machines,
                   the software that ran on them, mass storage of that time, and the software
                   development environment.  I will show pictures of some of the
                   remarkable pieces of hardware from that time, and will have a show and tell
                   of artifacts."
